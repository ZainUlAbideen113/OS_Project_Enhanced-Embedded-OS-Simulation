Enhanced Embedded OS Simulation

Description
This project is an enhanced embedded operating system simulation that monitors real-time system parameters such as CPU usage, memory usage, battery status, network activity, and top processes using Python. It features a Tkinter-based graphical user interface (GUI) for real-time visualization and logging.

Features
- Real-time CPU monitoring
- Memory usage tracking
- Battery status display
- Network activity monitoring
- Task manager with top processes
- Graphical representation using Matplotlib
- Multi-threaded execution for real-time updates

Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (GUI framework)
- Matplotlib (Graphing)
- Psutil (System monitoring)
- Threading & Queue (Concurrency management)
